        <p>I would like to share my IG exam journey with you all in this blog post. This year, I went through the IG exam, which was a very important event for me. I have been studying IG for two years, and during that time, my studies have had ups and downs, challenges, and moments of realizing the true meaning of knowledge. In the first year of my IG studies, I didn’t really understand it, and I only thought that I needed to learn the course content and memorize the knowledge points. I didn’t know how to apply the knowledge and understanding to real-life situations. That year, I was a bit careless. In the second year of my IG studies, I straightened my attitude and took my studies and classes more seriously. It turned out to be effective, and my grades improved. However, in the countless small and big exams I had taken in the past, I would always get nervous and perform poorly. After realizing this problem of mine, I tried to adjust my mindset by spending most of my time reviewing before exams, but to balance it out, I still insisted on playing soccer and badminton. This mindset made me answer questions more carefully in exams, but it also made me feel nervous and anxious. I’m sure you’ve all experienced insomnia or difficulty concentrating before exams. But we have to overcome these challenges to grow and develop. So, before the big exam this time, I made a conscious effort to get more rest and receive encouragement from those around me, such as eating a piece of candy or repeating positive affirmations to myself. Throughout this process, my parents were also a big part of my support system, and they played an important role in my studies during the exam period. They helped me find teachers and solutions when I encountered difficulties, analyzed the reasons behind my problems, and provided emotional support when I was confused or depressed. If we encounter challenges in important stages of our lives, we can also seek help from the outside world, which I think is one of the most effective methods. In addition, you can find your friends to study with and analyze problems together. Teaching others can be a more effective way to help your own learning, and learning with your friends can also create more interesting memory points and help you learn more and practice more. In fact, more often than not, after two years at school, I still believe that the classroom is a highly efficient place. One missed class may take many extra classes to make up for, so it’s important to make full use of every class and visit the teacher’s office more often to ask questions. All of this can be very helpful for our studies and can also improve our teacher-student relationships. Although there are some regrets about the exam results, these experiences are genuine gains that have been truly beneficial in my subsequent studies. They have also provided me with a lot of foresight, allowing me to plan and prepare for my junior and senior years, set clear goals, and work hard to achieve them. In short, I hope that this article can be helpful or relatable to anyone who is currently going through or preparing for a big exam. Goodbye everyone!</p>
