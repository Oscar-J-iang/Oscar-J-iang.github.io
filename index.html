        <p>I won’t mark the time in detail during my time in the UK, because I did too much every day and forgot which day it happened.</p>
<p>I clearly remember that the mayor of Cambridge came to the college to share with us what the UK is and what kind of city Cambridge is, but it was a pity that I didn’t record it because I didn’t take pictures. After that, Ms. Laura, the principal of Cambridge Dream, held a mobilization meeting to familiarize us with the student mentors and classmates.</p>
<p>Then we were divided into four groups, namely STEM, AI, ECO, and MEDICINE. I originally chose to go to STEM, but somehow I was assigned to the AI group. However, through so many days of study, I unknowingly developed some interest in artificial intelligence, and I also tried to write some different codes myself, using modules such as decision trees to process data. I learned computer knowledge that I couldn’t learn in school, and also learned a lot of software that has never appeared in China, such as the music listening software spodify, which cannot be found in China.</p>
<p> ![Cambridge Dream2.1](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.1.jpg) </p>
<p>![Cambridge Dream2.2](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.2.jpg)</p>
<p>It’s not just tutoring, there are also lectures from different fields, such as a workshop on climate adaptation community interaction by Dr Rachel Thorley, fellow of Churchill college. There are lectures on deep sea knowledge by Dr Helen Scoles, etc.</p>
<p>![Cambridge Dream2.3](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.3.jpg)</p>
<p>We visited the British Museum and were deeply attracted by the objects on display there. The London Eye, Big Ben and other iconic buildings. I have to say that I really like the lifestyle of the British people. Weekends should not be spent working overtime or staying at home playing games. Sitting on the lawn and chatting with family or friends is also a good lifestyle. What’s funny is that my mentor Josh lay down when he heard that I liked the lawn very much.</p>
<p> ![Cambridge Dream2.4](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.4.jpg) </p>
<p>![Cambridge Dream2.5](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.5.jpg)</p>
<p>We also felt the enthusiasm of the British people, the local characteristics and some historical sites.<br>Whether it was the wonderful speech by anthropologist Professor McFarland, the unique British social etiquette, role-playing, the unique Ceilidh dance in the UK, or the Midsummer Night’s Dream performed in the outdoor park, I loved them all.</p>
<p>![Cambridge Dream2.6](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.6.jpg)</p>
<p>  ![Cambridge Dream2.7](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.7.jpg)</p>
<p>![Cambridge Dream2.8](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.8.jpg)</p>
<p>What impressed me the most was the British “food”.<br>It may be because we mostly ate in the cafeteria, but it did not affect my perception of British food. In my opinion, breakfast is the most delicious. Although it is the same every day, I will drink different teas to match this single food. Lunch and dinner are slightly inferior to breakfast. The food is fresh but tasteless. I hope the chef can add more salt, and cakes and other desserts can put less sugar, thank you</p>

<p>![Cambridge Dream2.10](C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\CambridgeDream\Cambridge Dream2.10.jpg)</p>
<p>There are many more that I won’t list one by one.</p>
<p>To sum up, I met a lot of new friends during this period, which indirectly improved my English ability, allowing me to communicate with them without obstacles. In addition, I felt the local culture, which laid a foundation for my long-term study in the UK. I learned a lot, not only knowledge, but also skills and abilities in dealing with people. To be honest, this trip to the UK was very helpful to me.</p>

        <p>This is a two-week study tour<br>7.27 8:00<br>We gathered at school and took a bus to Shanghai Pudong Airport. To be honest, I wanted to go home on the way, but the positive and optimistic attitude of my classmates made me not so sad.<br>7.28 1:00<br>After more than four hours of travel, we arrived at Shanghai Pudong Airport, but unfortunately our tutor did not arrange a place to stay, so we could only wait at the airport until the plane took off in the morning. This period of time was really difficult. The plane took off at nearly 12 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>7.28 23:00<br>That is, at 16:00 UK time, we arrived in London, and then we were taken to Newham College of Cambridge University to rest. It should be that the climate in the UK is too different from that in China, I caught a cold as soon as I got off the plane.</p>

        <p>I would like to share my IG exam journey with you all in this blog post. This year, I went through the IG exam, which was a very important event for me. I have been studying IG for two years, and during that time, my studies have had ups and downs, challenges, and moments of realizing the true meaning of knowledge. In the first year of my IG studies, I didn’t really understand it, and I only thought that I needed to learn the course content and memorize the knowledge points. I didn’t know how to apply the knowledge and understanding to real-life situations. That year, I was a bit careless. In the second year of my IG studies, I straightened my attitude and took my studies and classes more seriously. It turned out to be effective, and my grades improved. However, in the countless small and big exams I had taken in the past, I would always get nervous and perform poorly. After realizing this problem of mine, I tried to adjust my mindset by spending most of my time reviewing before exams, but to balance it out, I still insisted on playing soccer and badminton. This mindset made me answer questions more carefully in exams, but it also made me feel nervous and anxious. I’m sure you’ve all experienced insomnia or difficulty concentrating before exams. But we have to overcome these challenges to grow and develop. So, before the big exam this time, I made a conscious effort to get more rest and receive encouragement from those around me, such as eating a piece of candy or repeating positive affirmations to myself. Throughout this process, my parents were also a big part of my support system, and they played an important role in my studies during the exam period. They helped me find teachers and solutions when I encountered difficulties, analyzed the reasons behind my problems, and provided emotional support when I was confused or depressed. If we encounter challenges in important stages of our lives, we can also seek help from the outside world, which I think is one of the most effective methods. In addition, you can find your friends to study with and analyze problems together. Teaching others can be a more effective way to help your own learning, and learning with your friends can also create more interesting memory points and help you learn more and practice more. In fact, more often than not, after two years at school, I still believe that the classroom is a highly efficient place. One missed class may take many extra classes to make up for, so it’s important to make full use of every class and visit the teacher’s office more often to ask questions. All of this can be very helpful for our studies and can also improve our teacher-student relationships. Although there are some regrets about the exam results, these experiences are genuine gains that have been truly beneficial in my subsequent studies. They have also provided me with a lot of foresight, allowing me to plan and prepare for my junior and senior years, set clear goals, and work hard to achieve them. In short, I hope that this article can be helpful or relatable to anyone who is currently going through or preparing for a big exam. Goodbye everyone!</p>
